## MVC Summary

MVC, standing for Model-View-Controller, is our structure for setting up web applications. Each of the three components of this structure have very specific responsibilities that keep our apps organized, and also provide us a way to delegate features without having to rewrite our entire code base any time we update our app.  

The Model provides the main structure of the application, behind the scenes. This involves our business logic, which is to say, our actions and algorithms that guide the data being sent to our view.

View is the main structure of the user-end of the application. This is our front end, where any user-input is involved, and the logic in the View is solely responsible for the user interface, and any content actually being delivered to our rendered web page.  

The controller works closely with the view, handling user interactions, and acting as an intermediary between the View and the Model.
