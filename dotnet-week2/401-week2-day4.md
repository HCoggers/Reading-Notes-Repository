4. Sorted list
5. Stack
6. Linked list

    6. A collection of objects that can only be accessed one to the next, not by index.
    2. A collection of objects that can be accessed by an index, like a resizeable array.
    3. A collection of objects that exhibit First-In, First-Out behavior.
    1. A collection of key-value pairs.
    5. A collection of objects that exhibit First-In, Last-Out behavior (in what order do we call methods?)
