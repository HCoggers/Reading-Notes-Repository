## OOP Principles

__OOP Vocab__
1. Inheritance
  - This is the ability of derived classes to inherit members (properties, methods, etc.) from base classes or interfaces. 
  A single derived class can only inherit from a sing base class, but can inherit from multiple interfaces.
2. Encapsulation
  - Encapsulation is the behavior of taking a group of members (i.e. an object or instantiated class) and treat them all as a single 
  entity or data type
3. Polymorphism
  - The concept that means if a certain data type is required, any derived classes or types that have a base of that type will be 
  considered acceptable at run time.
  
1. Base / Derived
  - A Base class is one that's members are inherited by one more other classes.
  - A Derived class is one that inherits some of its members from another class.
2. Class
  - A class is a type of object. It has properties, methods, constructors, and (private) fields, that may or may not be used by an Object.
3. Object
  - An object is an instance of a class. it contains all non-static members of that class, besides its constructors.
4. Interface
  - An interface is like a blueprint for a class or struct (?), it is never instantiated, only used as a base of promised methods and members
  for classes to inherit.
5. Abstract
  - an abstract member is one that has not been completed, but can be implemented fully in a derived class.
6. Virtual
  - a virtual member has a definition, but can be overridden and redifined with the keyword override
  - You may have done this in your code challenge to override the Object.ToString method
7. Sealed
  - Sealed is used to close off an inherited virtual member from further inheritance and overrides.
