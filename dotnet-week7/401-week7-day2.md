## SendGrid
SendGrid is a cloud-based email service that provides reliable transactional email delivery, scalability, and real-time analytics along with flexible APIs that make custom integration easy.  
You can sign up for a free 25,000 emails/month SendGrid account through your azure portal, just create a new resource group and search for SendGrid.  
To use SendGrid you'll need an API key, which you can create in settings on their portal. You'll also need to install the SendGrid Nuget Package in Visual Studio.  

SendGrid's .NET class library contains the following namespaces and functionality:
- SendGrid for communicating with SendGrid's API.
- SendGrid.Helpers.Mail for helper methods to easily create SendGridMessage objects that specify how to send emails.
