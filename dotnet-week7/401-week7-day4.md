### Week 7, Thursday
## Authorize.NET
Authorize.NET is a digital payment API that helps accept electronic transactions, use specialized payment methods and processes, like E-Checks or recurring billing, and store sensitive customer data.  

Auth.NET also has a testing sandbox that functions just like their production API but only responds to the sandbox keys and data that they provide, so no real-life transactions will be taking place. They have a set of sandbox credit card numbers, zip codes, and CVV codes so that no real-life information has any worry of being needed for testing.
