| 1. `Vertex`                 |     | a) A graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional.  This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction. |
| 2. `Edge`                   |     | b) Graph representation through a 2-dimensional array.  If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n  Boolean matrix. |
| 3. `Neighbour`              |     | c) The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e.,  are connected via an edge.                                              |
| 4. `Degree`                 |     | d) A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can  have zero or more adjacent vertices.                                |
| 5. `Undirected Graph`       |     | e) A graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers  are called weights.                                                 |
| 6. `Directed Graph/Digraph` |     | f) A graph where all nodes are connected to all other nodes.                                                                      |
| 7. `Complete Graph`         |     | g) The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected  to that vertex.                                                       |
| 8. `Connected Graph`        |     | h) A directed graph without cycles. A cycle is when a node  can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.       |
| 9. `Acyclic Graph`          |     | i) A connection between two nodes, or vertices.                                                                                   |
| 11. `Adjacency Matrix`      |     | j) A graph where every edge is directed.                                                                                          |
| 12. `Weighted Graph`        |     | k) A graph where all vertices/nodes have at least one edge.                                                                       |
