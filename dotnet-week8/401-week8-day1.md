## Blob Storage
**Blob Storage** is Microsoft's cloud storage service for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data.
Objects in Blob storage can be accessed through azure, whether through their storage REST API, Powershell or CLI, or just a storage client library.
Blob storage is structured similar to a file directory, with a single account, holding related containers (like a folder), and multiple blobs can be stored in those containers.

**Blobs**
- Block blobs store text and binary data
- Append blobs are ideal for appending data, such as logging data
- Page blobs store full files, up to 8TB in size.
