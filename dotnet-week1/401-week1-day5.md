## Linked Lists

Linked Lists are a linear data structure in C#. this basically means that a Linked List is a series of data that can be traversed 
through sequentially, unlike say, arrays, which can be accessed at any point by an index number, a linked list must always be accessed
from one *node* directly to the one next to it, then next to that, and so on. a __node__ is one unit of data in a linked list.  
There are two varieties of link lists. *Singly* linked and *Doubly* Linked. whereas a __singly__ linked list can only be traversed one way,
from beginning to end (i. e. each node only has a *single link*), __doubly__ linked lists can move in either direction, from one node to 
next or the previous node.
