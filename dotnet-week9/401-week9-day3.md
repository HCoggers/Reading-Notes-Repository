# Open-Source Software
Tips for contributing to open-source projects:  
1. Learn how to use Github and explore a repository:  
   [Github's Hello World Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)  

2. Take advantage of GH's search engine:  
   [Code Search](https://github.com/search)  
   Filter by (language preference, recently updated, etc.)

3. Find beginner-friendly OSS that has been tagged with:  
   [First-Timers-Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

4. Remember, it doesn't all have to be big bug fixes, or magically efficient refactors.  
   - Write an article for an open source wiki.  
   - Fix some typos or grammar errors in someone's README.  
   - Any commit is a contribution!
