## Xamarin
Xamarin is an open-source platform for building mobile applications with .NET. What's great about Xamarin is that 90% of your codebase when using it works cross-platform. Meaning you can build the same app for ios and android and even Windows without having to rewrite your code 3 different times!  
Xamarin apps are built from `.xaml` files, including markup tags to structure the content and styling in the app, and use backing code in `xaml.cs` files for their c# logic to manipulate those tags.
